**Why Mid-Rise Residential Buildings Are the New Goldmine for Elevator Companies in Taiwan Elevator Market**

**Introduction**

In recent years, the **[Taiwan Elevator Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/taiwan-elevator-market)** has undergone a transformation driven by shifting demographics, urban renewal projects, and housing trends. While high-rise towers have traditionally dominated elevator installations, a new player has entered the scene: mid-rise residential buildings.

These buildings—typically ranging from 5 to 12 stories—are now emerging as the most promising segment for elevator manufacturers and service providers. From Taipei to Tainan, developers and residents alike are recognizing the value of elevator access in mid-rise developments, fueling a demand surge that industry experts are calling “Taiwan’s next vertical goldmine.”

In this article, we explore why mid-rise residential buildings are becoming a hotspot for elevator investments in Taiwan, what’s driving this market shift, and how elevator companies are capitalizing on the opportunity.

**Defining the Mid-Rise Segment in Taiwan**

In Taiwan, mid-rise buildings typically refer to structures between 5 and 12 floors. Traditionally, these buildings may have been built without elevators—especially those under 7 floors, constructed before elevator mandates became standard in residential planning.

However, changes in population dynamics, accessibility needs, and real estate trends are putting mid-rises in the spotlight. Retrofitting elevators into older buildings and incorporating them into new mid-rise construction projects is now a national priority.

**Key Factors Driving Elevator Demand in Mid-Rise Buildings**

**1. Taiwan’s Aging Population**

According to Taiwan’s Ministry of the Interior, by 2025, over 20% of the population will be aged 65 or older, officially making Taiwan a super-aged society. For elderly residents, stairs are a barrier to independent living—especially in older walk-up buildings.
This demographic shift is creating unprecedented demand for elevators in mid-rise residential buildings, especially in urban neighborhoods where seniors prefer to stay.

 **2. Government Urban Renewal and Retrofitting Programs**

Taiwan’s government has launched several initiatives to encourage elevator installations in existing mid-rise buildings, including:
   
    • The Urban Regeneration Act
    • Subsidy programs for elevator retrofits in buildings without them
    • Accessibility improvement grants under the Ministry of Health and Welfare

These programs offer up to 50% subsidies for elevator installation in eligible buildings, creating a lucrative opportunity for elevator companies.

**3. Real Estate Market Evolution**

The high cost of land and limited space in city centers has led to a rise in mid-rise developments in second-tier cities and suburbs. Developers are turning to mid-rises for:
    
    • Faster construction timelines
    • Lower maintenance costs
    • More flexible zoning regulations

Including elevators in these developments significantly increases market appeal and property value, making it a win-win for both builders and buyers.

**4. Accessibility and Building Code Updates**

Recent updates to Taiwan’s building codes now mandate elevators in most new mid-rise residential buildings. Additionally, universal design standards are being enforced to improve accessibility.
This is accelerating the adoption of compact, energy-efficient elevators in mid-rise structures, which are smaller but still require the same safety and performance standards as high-rise systems.

**How Elevator Companies Are Capitalizing**
 
 **Product Innovation for Mid-Rise Markets**

Major elevator brands have begun designing compact elevator models specifically for mid-rise buildings. These models emphasize:
   
    • Space efficiency
    • Lower noise levels
    • Energy-saving technologies
    • Cost-effective installation

For example:
   
    • KONE’s MonoSpace® 300 targets mid-rise and low-rise buildings with a machine-room-less (MRL) design.
    • Mitsubishi Electric offers compact, retrofittable models with minimal shaft modification.
    • Otis Gen2 Life is optimized for buildings between 5–12 floors, boasting energy efficiency and flexible configuration.

**Smart Features Tailored for Small Communities**

Residents of mid-rise buildings now expect smart elevator features, such as:
    
    • Mobile call apps
    • Touchless controls
    • Energy usage monitoring
    • Voice assistance for the elderly

These features are scaled-down but still highly functional versions of those in high-rise smart buildings, ensuring cost-effectiveness for smaller communities.

**Case Studies: Mid-Rise Success Stories**

** Xinbei Residential District (New Taipei City)**

A 7-floor apartment complex installed a KONE MonoSpace system in 2023, resulting in:
   
    • 30% increase in rental yield
    • Faster property turnover
    • Reduced vacancy rates
 
 **Kaohsiung Retrofit Project**

Otis collaborated with a property management group to retrofit elevators into 20+ six-floor buildings, achieving:
   
    • Improved accessibility for over 600 elderly residents
    • Reduced emergency medical call response times
    • Successful government subsidy approval within 3 months

**Challenges and Considerations in the Mid-Rise Elevator Market**
 
 1. Installation Constraints

Older mid-rise buildings often lack space for an internal shaft, requiring creative solutions such as:
    
    • External elevator installations
    • Steel-frame retrofitted shafts
    • Use of stairwell or balcony space

2. Cost Sharing and Resident Buy-In

For retrofits, cost is a major hurdle. Coordinating multiple residents in shared ownership buildings to agree on funding can be time-consuming.

3. Regulatory Approval

Despite subsidies, the approval process can be complex. Elevator companies need to guide building managers through zoning, engineering checks, and compliance filings.

 4. Maintenance Infrastructure

Mid-rise buildings often lack a dedicated facility manager or engineer, requiring elevator companies to offer remote diagnostics and on-call support for peace of mind.
With more smart city initiatives, aging-in-place policies, and infill development projects, the growth of elevators in this segment is far from temporary—it’s the future of urban living in Taiwan.

**Conclusion**

Taiwan’s mid-rise residential buildings represent an untapped goldmine for elevator companies. Driven by demographics, policy incentives, and real estate dynamics, this market is transforming from a niche opportunity into a core revenue stream.

With innovation in compact elevator design, smart retrofitting solutions, and senior-focused accessibility features, elevator providers are now racing to dominate this critical segment of Taiwan’s vertical mobility future.

For companies that can offer affordable, compliant, and tech-enhanced solutions, the mid-rise elevator boom in Taiwan is not just a trend—it’s a multi-billion NT$ opportunity in the making.
